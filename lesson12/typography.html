                    <h4 class="font-forum">FORUM</h4>
                    <p class="font-desc">I chose Forum as a font for the top headers because it exudes an air of respectability and gravitas that seems to fit the organization that the website will represent. This font will be used for the site name and some headlines. I will use this font with all-uppercase characters only.</p>

                <section id="heading-font-2" class="font-box">
                    <h4>Merriweather Sans 500</h4>
                    <p class="font-desc">I chose Merriweather Sans 500 as a secondary heading font, with less emphasis on style and more on readability. The font will be used for longer headlines like section headers and navigation.</p>

                    <p class="font-lato">And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.</p>
                    <p class="font-lato">And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.</p>
                    <p class="font-desc">I chose Merriweather as a primary paragraph font because it is clean and very readable, and has a good contrast with the heading fonts.</p>
